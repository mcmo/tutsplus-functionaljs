  "description": "Learn the basics of functional programming in JavaScript. You'll take a small, mostly imperative website and refactor it using practical declarative and functional concepts. You'll learn about pure functions, side-effects and declarative style while building a small functional utility library that will demonstrate how Underscore or Lodash functions like `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` really work. Focused on practical understanding over philosophy, this is a great basic intro to functional programming that will prepare you for deeper exploration.",
